🧠 CIFAR-10 Image Classification using TensorFlow & Keras (Colab)
This project demonstrates how to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 10 classes of objects like airplanes, automobiles, cats, and more.

✅ The notebook is Colab-ready — you can run it directly without installing anything locally.

📦 Project files
tf_cifar10_classification_colab.ipynb — main Jupyter notebook
README.md — this guide

🚀 How to use
Go to Google Colab
Upload tf_cifar10_classification_colab.ipynb
Run each cell step by step:
Load & explore CIFAR-10 dataset
Build and train the CNN model
Evaluate accuracy and plot learning curves
Make predictions and visualize results
The notebook will automatically download the CIFAR-10 dataset — no need to upload anything.

🔍 Model overview
2 convolutional layers (32 & 64 filters)
Max pooling
Flatten + Dense layers
Output layer with 10 classes (softmax)
Trained for a few epochs on ~50,000 training images.

📊 Results
Accuracy over epochs plotted
Final test accuracy printed
Visualization of model predictions on sample images

🧰 Libraries used
TensorFlow / Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib

✨ Possible extensions
✅ Use deeper / more advanced CNN
✅ Use data augmentation
✅ Deploy the trained model as a:
  -Web app (Streamlit / Flask)
  -API
✅ Try transfer learning with pre-trained models
